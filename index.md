Capstone Project - Greenhouse Monitoring System
-----------------------------------------------

### October 1, 2019 - Parts Ordered

The Raspberry Pi 4, capacitive soil sensor, and diaphragm pump have been ordered from Amazon:

I will be picking up some of the other components (headers, jumper connectors, spray nozzle, fittings, etc) from Sayal Electronics and Princess Auto during this week.

I have decided to choose the Raspberry Pi 4 instead of the 3 B+. Over the last week I have done some research/comparison of the two models. The Pi 4 has a noticeable edge over its predecessor in processing power, memory, GPU performance, microSD card read/write speeds, and networking speed. All of this for a modest price increase. While there are still few small bugs with the model 4 (which shouldn't affect this project), it made more sense for future proofing and long term reusability.


### September 24, 2019 - Budget Due

Click on the [budget](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/budget/GreenhouseBudget.pdf) to view the projected costs.

Need to discuss with the professor today whether to use a relay, transistor, or code to turn the effector on/off. *UPDATE* Kristian has suggested speaking to Kelly or Vlad regarding this

Decided on the capacitive moisture sensor instead of resistive, due to more accurate readings and corrosion resistance. Have sourced the Gikfun EK1940 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Gikfun-Capacitive-Corrosion-Resistant-Detection/dp/B07H3P1NRM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=capacitive+soil&qid=1569351693&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyNzJZWjNOOEFLM0E0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjg0MjI4Ukg0RVgxWUdTMktNJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0MDYyODNFOUpQM0hWM1I3QVUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl).


### September 17, 2019 - Schedule Due

Here you can view the proposed [project schedule](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.pdf) pdf or [Microsoft Project file](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.mpp).

*Repository edit: Proposal and schedule files moved into nested folders inside Documentation folder.

Met with our project sponsor (Valeria) and received great feedback regarding different features we can implement/how to implement. Meeting report to follow soon.
