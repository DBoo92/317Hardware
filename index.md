Capstone Project - Greenhouse Monitoring System
-----------------------------------------------

### October 1, 2019 - Parts Ordered

The Raspberry Pi 4, capacitive soil sensor, and diaphragm pump have been ordered from Amazon:

I will be picking up some of the other components (headers, jumper connectors, spray nozzle, fittings, etc) from Sayal Electronics and Princess Auto during this week.

I have decided to choose the Raspberry Pi 4 instead of the 3 B+. Over the last week I have done some research/comparison of the two models. The Pi 4 has a noticeable edge over its predecessor in processing power, memory, GPU performance, microSD card read/write speeds, and networking speed. All of this for a modest price increase. While there are still few small bugs with the model 4 (which shouldn't affect this project), it made more sense for future proofing and long term reusability.

### September 24, 2019 - Budget Due

Click on the [budget](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/budget/GreenhouseBudget.pdf) to view the projected costs.

Need to discuss with the professor today whether to use a relay, transistor, or code to turn the effector on/off.

>Kristian has suggested speaking to Kelly or Vlad regarding this.

Decided on the capacitive moisture sensor instead of resistive, due to more accurate readings and corrosion resistance. I have sourced the Gikfun EK1940 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07H3P1NRM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I will also be incorporating a pump/nozzle system to spray water on the soil when moisture readings are low. I will be using the Gikgun EK1856C from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0744DL1S9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

### September 17, 2019 - Schedule Due

Here you can view the proposed [project schedule pdf](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.pdf) or [Microsoft Project file](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.mpp) if you have the software.

>Repository edit: Proposal and schedule files moved into nested folders inside Documentation folder.

Met with our project sponsor (Valeria) and received great feedback regarding different features we can implement/how to implement. Meeting report to follow soon.
