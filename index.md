Capstone Project - Greenhouse Monitoring System
-----------------------------------------------

### October 1, 2019 - Parts Ordered

The Raspberry Pi 4, capacitive soil sensor, and diaphragm pump have been ordered from ![Amazon.ca](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/images/partsorder.png)


### September 24, 2019 - Budget Due

Click on the [budget](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/budget/GreenhouseBudget.xlsx) to view the projected costs.

Need to discuss with the professor today whether to use a relay, transistor, or code to turn the effector on/off.

Decided on capacitive moisture sensor instead of resistive, due to more accurate readings and corrosion resistance. Have sourced the Gikfun EK1940 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Gikfun-Capacitive-Corrosion-Resistant-Detection/dp/B07H3P1NRM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=capacitive+soil&qid=1569351693&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyNzJZWjNOOEFLM0E0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjg0MjI4Ukg0RVgxWUdTMktNJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0MDYyODNFOUpQM0hWM1I3QVUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl).


### September 17, 2019 - Schedule Due

Here you can view the proposed [project schedule](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.pdf) pdf or [Microsoft Project file](https://github.com/DBoo92/317Hardware/blob/master/documentation/schedule/Project1.mpp).

*Repository edit: Proposal and schedule files moved into nested folders inside Documentation folder.

Met with our project sponsor (Valeria) and received great feedback regarding different features we can implement/how to implement. Meeting report to follow soon.
